# About this project

CovidDExp (COVID-19 Data Exploration) is an exploratory data analysis
tool with a visually rich presentation of the COVID-19 pandemic. It
includes processing of reliable real-time evolving data with qualitative
data examined against a series of selected indicators to monitor and
detail the worldwide virus outbreak situation under a holistic approach.

# Motivation

CovidDExp was born by scientific curiosity and eagerness to understand
and examine the global pandemic crisis and its parameters from the data
scientist perspective. Beyond the evolution of the pandemic and epidemic
statistics, our intention is to discover and explore correlations and
connections with socio-economic and governmental indicators that can
highlight alternate angles and provide further insights to the
interested viewer. This initiative is launched and supported by members
of the [Data and Web Science Lab](https://datalab.csd.auth.gr) (DATALAB)
an active research group
engaged in ICT research and innovation on data science and multi scope
analytics under the [Department of Informatics](https://www.csd.auth.gr),
[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr), Greece.
